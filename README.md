# MessagingRedisCache

[`MessagingRedisCache`](/src/MessagingRedisCache/README.md) is an implementation of [`IDistributedCache`](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/libraries/Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Abstractions/src/IDistributedCache.cs) using [`RedisCache`](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/Caching/StackExchangeRedis/src/RedisCache.cs) as a base implementation. `MessagingRedisCache` will utilize [Redis pub/sub](https://redis.io/topics/pubsub) to ensure that cache entries can be synchronized in a distributed system, where direct deferral to Redis is not always performant. Because of this, it is a functional backing store for [`HybridCache`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/caching/hybrid) which will also evict the `IMemoryCache` entries in distributed systems.

# L1L2RedisCache

[`L1L2RedisCache`](/src/L1L2RedisCache/README.MD) is an implementation of [`IDistributedCache`](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/libraries/Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Abstractions/src/IDistributedCache.cs) with emphasis on performance. It leverages [`IMemoryCache`](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/libraries/Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Abstractions/src/IMemoryCache.cs) as a level 1 cache and [`MessagingRedisCache`](/src/MessagingRedisCache/README.md) as a level 2 cache, with level 1 evictions being managed via [Redis pub/sub](https://redis.io/topics/pubsub).
